# Zero to Mastery - React Course (Master Project)

:recycle: This repo is an updated codebase of the master projct in this course [This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

Converted the codebase to functional components, using react hooks and etc.

## Class VS Functional

I went through this course 2 years ago.
Definitely one of the best courses out there on React. :fire:

But the codebase is based on Class components, So as a practice I decided to convert the entire master project to functional components and use React hooks instead.

I recommend using the course to first learn about class components, then you can use this repo and see what has changed.
Because at some time you would most likely run into some code that has been written in class components.

So It helps to have a reference of both ways on a large and extensive React app.
